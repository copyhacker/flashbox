Feedback
========

This is a trivial plugin to render feedback messages to the user. A feedback
message is a string, paired with a level. The level is a string suggesting
how the message ought to be displayed. The value of level will usually be one
of the following:
- info
- warning
- error

This plugin installs a stylesheet, feedback.css, which is not required, but
provides a reasonable default look and feel, inspired by GMail.

Example
=======

Feedback messages are appended to the queue from your controllers by using the
add_feedback method.
>> add_feedback("Hello, user!", "info")

Shortcut methods are provided for adding feedback at the most common levels.
>> add_info("Hello, user!") # Identical to the example above.

The easiest way to bootstrap the feedback js is to use the feedback_init helper
in your layouts.
<%= javascript_include_tag 'feedback' # Include feedback.js first! %>
<%= stylesheet_link_tag 'feedback' %>
<%= feedback_init %>

You may also add feedback via RJS, provided that feedback has been bootstrapped
in the page you are updating.
>> render :update do |page|
>>   page << "feedback.info('Hello, AJAX!');"
>> end
